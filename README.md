## 🏆 Hackathon Info  
- **Hackathon Name**: NEURAX Hackathon 2025  
- **Track/Theme**: AI in Agriculture 
- **Team Name**: AgriHackers  
- **Team ID**: NA11

## 🌟 Project Overview  
Our project addresses the challenge of crop disease identification for rural farmers who often lack access to timely agricultural advice.  
AgriVaani (Farmer’s Crop Doctor) provides a simple, bilingual (Telugu + English) app that detects diseases, suggests remedies, and offers audio guidance.  
This matters because it empowers farmers with accessible, tech-driven solutions to protect crops, reduce losses, and improve their livelihoods.
Built with **React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS**, the app is designed to be fast, modern, and user-friendly.
